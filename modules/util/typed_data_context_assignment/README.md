## Recommended Patches

### Issue #3251391
This [issue](https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/issues/3251391) contains a patch that moves the context assignment
generation in core into the context handler service. This will make the advanced assignment options available on all
plugins, not just plugins overridden here.
